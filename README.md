Poppik ‚Äî The Meme-Powered Web3 Auction & Pricing GameÔºà1.0 not finished yet)

Poppik is a community-driven, meme-fueled, token-incentivized auction platform reinventing how value is priced, played with, and owned on the blockchain. Built with fun, speculation, and viral consensus at its core, Poppik lets users guess prices, win rewards, and trade fractionalized real-world & digital assets in a Roblox-style UI.


Key Features

- **Auction + Voting Hybrid Game** ‚Äî Guess the price of meme-worthy or RWA assets, and vote to shape the price consensus.
- **Token Incentives (PIKP)** ‚Äî Users earn $PIKP tokens by participating, voting, and engaging with assets.
- **Fractionalized Ownership** ‚Äî Popular assets are tokenized and distributed to voters and bidders.
- **Community-Priced RWA** ‚Äî From luxury watches to meme NFTs to real estate, value is set by the crowd.
- **Meme Culture UI** ‚Äî Roblox-style, pastel-colored, lollipop-cyberpunk aesthetic for viral appeal.

How It Works

1. Assets are Listed ‚Äî Users or partners list rare/meme/RWA items for consensus-based auction.
2. Users Vote & Bid ‚Äî Everyone votes on what it‚Äôs worth. Bidders try to win at a fair price.
3. Price is Set by Consensus** ‚Äî The most voted price becomes the benchmark.
4. Rewards & Tokens ‚Äî Winners get NFTs or fractions, voters earn $PIKP, and engagement is gamified.
